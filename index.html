									<h2>SB 1383</h2>
									<p>Starting January 1, 2022, supermarkets and grocery stores must comply with the requirements set forth by SB 1383. They must recover the maximum amount of edible food that would otherwise be disposed of by partnering with food recovery organizations and arrange food collection for food recovery with said organization. Food generators also can’t intentionally spoil edible food that is capable of being collected by food service organizations. These supermarkets and/or grocery stores also have to keep a record of each food recovery organization that collects the edible food and a copy of contracts between grocery store/supermarket and food recovery organization.</p>

									<h2>Protection for Food Donors</h2>
                                    <p>Many companies fear donating food in case someone is to get sick from the food, and then they are held responsible. Luckily for them, the California Good Samaritan Food Donation Act specifically protects businesses against legal action taken against them as long as the donated food was checked beforehand for freshness, was donated in good faith, and there were no instances of gross negligence. </p>
